/*
Feed is a data model for a column of newsfeed

Id: primary key, use to identify a feed
CreatedAt: time when entity is created
UpdatedAt: time when Feed is updated. This timestamp is used to determine whether
this feed is unchanged.
CreatorID:
Creator: user who added this source, "belongs-to" relation

Name: feed's display name (title)
Subscribers: all users who subscribed to this feed, "many-to-many" relation
Posts: all posts published to this feed, "many-to-many" relation

-- Sources: All sources this feed is listening to, "many-to-many" relationship.
-- We don't keep sources, since we assume there is always a sub-source "default" for each source
-- For those sources without subsource like wall-street-news, we use the "default" subsource only

SubSources: All subsources this feed is listening to, "many-to-many" relationship.

	Do not only rely on subsource to infer source, so that we can have Feed only subscribe to source
